# Problem Solving Approach

## What is an Algorithm?
A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task.

Almost everything you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm! It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer.

## Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples
* Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
* Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
* User stories
* Unit tests

### Process
1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Break it Down
**Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.**

This forces you to think about the code you'll write before writing it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details like language syntax.

## Solve/Simplify
* Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
* Temporarily ignore that difficulty
* Write a simplified solution
* Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look Back and Refactor
* Can you check the result?
* Can you derive the result differently?
* Can you understand it at a glance?
* Can you us the result of method for some other problem?
* Can you improve the performance of your solution?
* Can you think of other ways to refactor?
* How have other people solved this problem?
